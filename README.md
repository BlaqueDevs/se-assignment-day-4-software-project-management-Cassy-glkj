## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Waterfall is more suitable for well-defined and stable projects, while agile is more appropriate for complex and evolving projects. Waterfall- You are developing a fitness app, and the customer's feedback helps with the evolution of the app and with any new updates. Waterfall- this is best used when you are following certain steps to be followed like how to build a calculator app.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
You can ensure quality by doing testing, fixing bugs, improving security on the app and maintaining a reliable high standard app.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
